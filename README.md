# [Project 1: Bike Share Company Riders in Chicago, Google Data Analytics Capstone Project using R](https://github.com/ChristineMJ/data_Science_portfolio)
* A Brief Description of the Bike Share Comapny: A bike share company based on Chicago, USA has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 sations accross Chicago region. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. A purpose of the project
* A purpose of the project: The company's finance analysts have concluded and advised a marketing director that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. How can the casual riders convert to the membership? Show key finding from the historical dataset.
* Data Source: Downloaded the previous 12 months cyclistic trips data(from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022) from the designated source provided by the Google Data Analyrics course. 
* File Size: 3.0 GB extracted in a zip file. 
* Types of riders: Casual riders: Casual riders are single-ride passes or full-day passes vs Membership riders are one off bike riders basically.
* Stakeholders for this project: Mr.Moreno who is a marketing director and has directed the clear goal of this project. Converting casual riders into annual members based on an analysis from the users' historial data.

Key Findings & Insights
- Throughout the year over 2022 the casual bike riders rode bikes on Sundays, Saturdays, Mondays and Fridays whereas the members rode bikes all over the weeks. The Wednesdays, Tuesdays and Mondays were the most popular days for bike-riding for the members.    

Suggestions
- The analytics shows that the members rides bikes during the weedays for shorter distance than the casual riders. If the fee for the one off casual riders increases and additional charges on the longer distance or longer ride lenths is reduced for the members, it will encourage the casual riders to join the membership. 
- The casual riders rodes from the Friday till Monday. They company can advertise the benefit of joining bike membership over the weekend.

# [Project 3. Cyber Attack Analysis](https://github.com/ChristineMJ/world_cyber_attack_analysis.git)
Purpose of this Anaylsis: 
Analyzing cyber attacks worldwide is crucial for improving cybersecurity awareness, developing effective security measures, improving incident response, prosecuting cyber criminals, and promoting global cooperation to protect against cyber threats.

There can be several reasons why these countries had a higher number of cyber attacks:
![TopValue](https://github.com/ChristineMJ/world_cyber_attack_analysis/blob/main/images/topvalue.jpeg)
Advanced technology: Countries that have more advanced technology may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks. This is because more advanced technology usually means more interconnected systems and more potential vulnerabilities.

- Political instability: Countries with political instability or conflicts may be more prone to cyber attacks, especially if the attackers have political motives.

- Economic factors: Countries with a high GDP and high economic activity may be more attractive targets for cyber criminals seeking to gain financial benefits.

- Cybersecurity awareness: Countries with lower levels of cybersecurity awareness and investment may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks.

- Geopolitical factors: Some countries may be targeted more frequently due to their geopolitical position, such as being a major ally or adversary of a particular nation or group.

It is important to note that the reasons for a higher number of cyber attacks are complex and multifaceted, and can vary depending on many different factors.

![10 Actors](https://github.com/ChristineMJ/world_cyber_attack_analysis/blob/main/images/top10actor.jpeg)

From this basebase, the most of cyber actors' location was undedetermined. However, the actors locations were in Russia, North Korea and Ukraine, Iran and China, Bengladesh and Cuba.   

![TimeTrend ](https://github.com/ChristineMJ/world_cyber_attack_analysis/blob/main/images/timetrend.jpeg)
The data indicates a consistent upward trend in the frequency and severity of cyber attacks over time.

There are several actions that organizations and individuals can take to protect themselves from cyber attacks:

- Both Indiviuals and organization keep software and systems up to date: This includes regularly installing updates and patches to fix security vulnerabilities in software and systems.
- Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication: Strong passwords that are difficult to guess can help prevent unauthorized access to systems and accounts. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring more than one form of identification to access an account.
- Train employees and users: Educating employees and users about cyber threats and how to recognize them can help prevent social engineering attacks, such as phishing.
- Use anti-malware and anti-virus software: These tools can detect and prevent malware and other malicious software from infecting systems.
- Implement network segmentation: Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller sub-networks to limit the spread of an attack in case one segment is compromised.
- Backup critical data: Regularly backing up important data can help ensure that it can be recovered in case of a cyber attack or other disaster.
- Develop an incident response plan: Having a plan in place for responding to cyber attacks can help minimize the impact and facilitate recovery.

Overall, taking a proactive approach to cybersecurity and implementing a combination of these actions can help organizations and individuals better protect themselves from cyber attacks.
